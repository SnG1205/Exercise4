He's found a strong niche in writing about true growth industries. His main focus for the last 5 years has been on the cannabis industry and marijuana stocks. He is one of the top contributors to cannabis media outlets like MarijuanaStocks.com. He also is head of social media management for StockMarket.com. Since an early age, Jonathan has been an active member of the cannabis culture. Coming from Miami, Florida, he's been able to identify emerging trends in the space including the emergence of cannabis derivatives, vapes, e-liquids, wax, and more. His ability to identify emerging niches has afforded him the ability to source valuable information from top industry names. Jonathan has also managed to build a strong social media presence for companies. He has worked with hundreds of public companies to develop a digital presence. As an active blogger and social media influencer, his focus is on lifestyle segments of the market. You can find Jonathan reporting on anything from industry conferences and investor events to corporate disclosures and cannabis market movers. Since the early days of marijuana companies going public, Jonathan has made it a point to find information before the crowd. The main target of his writing is on undiscovered or under-researched companies that could hold true, lasting market potential. Through his research, Jonathan has managed to be one of the early writers to identify the opportunity of cannabis over other things like alcohol and he was one of the first reporters to cover the multi-billion dollar deals that materialized in 2017 and 2018. He has also covered the emergence of multi-state operators in the U.S. after Canada paved the way in late 2018 and 2019 for legalization in North America. Jonathan is also an active member of the underground hip-hop scene. He has worked with some of the biggest names in the rap community while also gaining valuable insight from top producers and business moguls focused on moving brands forward. In his free time, Jonathan builds social communities and continues to hone his skills as a leading financial writer.","sameAs":["https://www.facebook.com/jonathan.heimann","https://www.instagram.com/heimannjonathan/","https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/TheRealJacc"],"url":"https://stockmarket.com/author/jonathan-phillip"}]}</script>

<h2 id="h-are-these-good-inflation-stocks-to-invest-in-now"><span id="are-these-good-inflation-stocks-to-invest-in-now">Are These Good Inflation Stocks To Invest In Now?</span></h2>



<p>As we start the current week of trading, inflation stocks appear to be on investors’ minds. For the uninitiated, this part of the <a href="http://www.stockmarket.com">stock market</a><strong> </strong>consists of stocks that perform well or show resilience during inflation. If anything, the economy has and continues to perform exceptionally as it recovers towards pre-pandemic levels. So much so that core inflation markers are starting to lean towards record highs. Just last week, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) surged by 5% year-over-year, its fastest pace since August 2008. For one thing, the rise in the cost of goods and services would stand to affect consumers and businesses alike.</p>



<p>In cases like this, some would argue that investors would be wise to add some inflation stocks to their portfolios. Namely, billionaire hedge fund manager <strong>Paul Tudor Jones</strong> said just that in an interview with CNBC earlier today. According to Jones, investors should “<em>go all-in on inflation trades</em>” should the Federal Reserve (Fed) remain unconcerned with rising consumer prices. While watching the Fed ahead of its policy meeting this week, he highlighted commodities, <a href="https://stockmarket.com/category/investing/crypto-bitcoin-btc">cryptocurrency</a>, and gold. As such, it would not surprise me to see more conservative investors looking for the top inflation stocks now.</p>



<p>For instance, commodity-based companies such as Freeport-McMoRan (<a href="https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=FCX">NYSE: FCX</a>) continue to prosper amidst rising material costs. Aside from commodities, the current market would also favor cryptocurrency players like MicroStrategy (<a href="https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=MSTR">NASDAQ: MSTR</a>) as the dollar potentially weakens. As it stands, both companies’ shares are currently looking at gains of over 275% in the past year. If you are looking to add some defensive inflation plays to your watchlist now, here are four making waves in the <a href="https://stockmarket.com/category/stock-market-trends-articles">stock market today</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-nvidia-corporation"><span id="nvidia-corporation">Nvidia Corporation</span></h2>



<p>Nvidia is a semiconductor company that has essentially pioneered the graphics processing unit (GPU) market. Its products and platforms are used for the large, growing markets of gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive industries. NVDA stock currently trades at $719.04 as of 12:22 p.m. ET. On May 31, 2021, the company announced its latest gaming flagship, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti GPU.</p>



<p>It is 1.5x faster than the previous generation and is priced at very competitive rates. Powered by the Nvidia Ampere architecture, the RTX 3080 Ti delivers an incredible leap in performance and fidelity with acclaimed features like ray tracing and Nvidia’s DLSS performance-boosting AI. Also, in late May, the company announced record first-quarter financials. Firstly, the company posted record revenue of $5.66 billion, up by 84% year-over-year. </p>



<p>A huge chunk of this revenue came from its gaming and data center segments at $2.76 billion and $2.05 billion respectively. Gaming revenue more than doubled year-over-year while data center revenue increased by 79% in that same period. With so many exciting things happening to the company, is NVDA stock a top inflation stock to consider buying?</p>

<h2 id="h-newmont-corporation"><span id="newmont-corporation">Newmont Corporation</span></h2>



<p>Newmont is one of the largest gold mining companies in the world. It has ownership of gold mines in Nevada, Ontario, Argentina, and Ghana among others. Aside from gold, it is also a producer of copper, silver, zinc, and lead. Impressively, it is also the only gold producer listed in the S&amp;P 500 Index and is an industry leader in value creation. NEM Stock currently trades at $69.47 as of 12:22 p.m. ET.</p>



<p>In May, the company announced that it had completed the acquisition of GT Gold Corporation. “<em>With the acquisition of GT Gold and the Tatogga project in the highly sought-after Golden Triangle district of British Columbia, Canada, Newmont continues to strengthen our world-class portfolio,</em>” said Newmont President and CEO Tom Palmer. </p>



<p>The acquisition of the Tatogga project has the potential to contribute to future significant gold and copper annual production for the company. There could also be further exploration opportunities within the land package. All things considered, will you buy NEM stock?</p>

<h2 id="h-riot-blockchain-inc"><span id="riot-blockchain-inc">Riot Blockchain Inc.</span></h2>



<p>Next up, we have Riot Blockchain Inc. For some context, the company is primarily in the business of mining Bitcoin. As such, Riot is constantly looking to expand and upgrade its mining operations. Similar to gold stocks, cryptocurrency stocks like RIOT stock would be in focus when inflation is running high. Evidently, that appears to be the case today as RIOT stock is up by over 19% on Monday and currently trades at $37.05 as of 12:23 p.m. ET. Would now be the time to jump on RIOT stock?</p>



<p>Well, if anything, Riot remains as busy as ever on the operational front. Just last week, the company wowed investors with its May 2021 Bitcoin production update. Impressively, Riot produced 227 bitcoins throughout the month, marking a 220% year-over-year surge. On top of that, Riot continues to expand its mining operations in the U.S. as well. In late May, the company completed its acquisition of Whinstone U.S.’ Bitcoin mining facility in Rockdale, Texas. </p>



<p>According to Riot, it is currently the largest Bitcoin mining facility in North America. Overall, the company appears to be firing on all cylinders while also finding new ways to significantly expand its portfolio. Would this make RIOT stock a top buy for you now?</p>
